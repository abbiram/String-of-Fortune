At a moments notice
All hands on deck
As cold as ice
As right as rain
Hot off the grill
Too close to call
Put on a pedestal
Going by the book
Right off the bat
Forever and a day
Make up your mind
Pick up the phone
An ace up your sleeve
Back to the drawing board
Best seat in the house
Dive off the deep end
Help me set up the table
